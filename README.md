# L0_Minimization
Image Smoothing using L0 gradient Minimization (Python implementation as part of Visual Computing Practical).

This code is based on the paper titled "Image smoothing via L0 gradient minimization" having the following official link "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2024156.2024208".

There are 3 files for 1d smoothing, 2d grayscale image smoothing and 2d rgb image smoothing respectively. The code uses numpy, opencv, os and matplotlib as the additional libraries.
